# **Clario — Odoo OCR Invoice Processing Addon**

Clario is a custom Odoo extension designed to simplify invoice and receipt management using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).  
It allows users to upload images/PDFs of invoices, extract key information using OCR + NLP, and automatically populate Odoo Accounting and Expenses modules.

This project is the Senior Project 2 (SP2) for **Assumption University**, built by a team of developers using Dockerized Odoo.
